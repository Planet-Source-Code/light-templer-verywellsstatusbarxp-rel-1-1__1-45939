Special Thanks:

          (www.vbaccelerator.com)

quality ActiveX controls. Without his
generosity and skills, this control would
not have happened.

Acknowledgements by Light Templer:

First of all: Sorry to Richard Wells!
I took his code and did some violance to
it ;). It seemed on Planet Source Code that
no more further development will take place
to this fine control and I missed a few
features ;) ...

Richard send me an email and told me he wants
to see my solution to the icon problem and the
new features. So I think its ok ;) and he will
forgive me.


Special thx to Carlos J. Quintero
      (www.mztools.com)
for his MZ Tools, the best allround addin for
VB you can get! (And, btw, it's freeware!)


Thx & regards to Keith "LaVolpe" Fox for his?
nice API timer / window prop reference trick.
(Check out 'LaVolpe Button' on Planet Source
Code! Fine stuff - best VB button you can get
with source code! Maybe best overall!)

Special thx to MIKE-S from PSC! :

He added the Office XP look, the 'AutoSize
to contents' feature and released the control
as xpWellsStatusbarXP 2 on 25/5/2003 on PSC.

I integrated some parts of his code and hope
he can forgive me, too.
