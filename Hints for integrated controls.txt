 How to integrate controls to VeryWellsStatusBarXp ?
=====================================================


The statusbar works as a container control (like a picturebox).
So just put on it what you want to! A progressbar for example
would be fine ... 

Now you can go three ways:

	1) Control them by your own code.
	   Ok. Do it. Set size and position to your needs.


	2) Control them using the statusbars events. There
	   are four events you can use for:

			a) TimerBeforeRedraw()
			b) TimerAfterRedraw()
			c) BeforeRedraw()
			d) AfterRedraw()

 	   The timer events (a+b) will raised before/after
	   the redrawing is done. Redrawing is requested by
	   timer interval.

	   The others (c+d) are raised every time the redrawing
	   is requested (by timer and all other sources).

	   In this events you can easily reposition your controls
 	   by your own code and do all other changes you want to.


	3) Controling done by the statusbar. This one is nice,
	   cover most of needs and requires only 13 chars in the
	   tag property of your integrated control, e.g.:

			### 04 0050 +

	   We need EXACTLY this format. 13 characters!
	   This example means: The control is put on panel number
	   four, 50 twips gap to the left border and yes, if this
	   panel has the 'spring panel' type (size changes to forms
	   size) the control automaticly changes its size too.
	   One more:

			### 01 0000 -

	   Means: Set control to left border of panel number one,
	  size don't changes during resizing the form.

	  Have a look to the tag property of the buttons and the
	  listbox I used on the demo form.


Sorry for wasting the tag property for this, but it seems to be the
easiest way to have control by standard user interface.
Other ideas welcome!
